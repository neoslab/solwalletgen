# Solana Wallet Batch Generator

![Bash Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/bash-5.2.37%2B-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This is a simple bash script to generate multiple **Solana wallets** (`.json` keypair files) and store them in a user-defined directory. It's ideal for developers, testers, or validators who need to bulk-create wallets quickly for automation, testing, or staking operations.

* * *

## Features

- Batch wallet creation using `solana-keygen`
- Randomized, readable wallet filenames (e.g., `k9dj3rsl.json`)
- Wallets saved in your chosen directory
- Skips generation if a filename already exists
- Displays public address after each wallet is created
- Compatible with Linux and macOS

* * *

## Requirements

- Solana CLI (`solana-keygen`) must be installed and in your `$PATH`
- Bash shell (Linux/macOS)

Install Solana CLI if not already installed:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
````

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-wallet-generator.git
cd solana-wallet-generator
```

### 2. Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x generate-wallets.sh
```

### 3. Run the script

```bash
./generate-wallets.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter:

* The number of wallets to generate
* The directory where the wallet `.json` files should be saved

Example output:

```
How many wallets do you want to create? 5
Enter the directory where wallets should be saved: ~/solana-wallets
[1] Created wallet: abx72dkc -> Hs5N...tFnQ
[2] Created wallet: q3lmn8dy -> 2qRV...uMvk
...
```

* * *

## File Naming

Wallets are saved with randomly generated lowercase filenames, such as:

```
~/solana-wallets/
 ├── abx72dkc.json
 ├── q3lmn8dy.json
 └── j8zxcv91.json
```

* * *

## Warnings

* Never share your `.json` keypair files publicly.
* This script generates wallets **without** a BIP39 passphrase. For high-security use, consider additional protection.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I reuse the same directory?**
A: Yes! The script will skip wallets if a file with the same name already exists.

**Q: How do I get the public address later?**
A: Run:

```bash
solana-keygen pubkey /path/to/wallet.json
```
